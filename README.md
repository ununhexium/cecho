# cecho

Color echo.

A sanitized `printf` alternative that also prints colors.

Actually works in `printf` style but with easy color and style specifiers.

It's named after echo for "marketing" purposes because that's what people will 
probably look for when the first want to print colored text.

## Examples

The quoting and escaping in these examples is assuming that you write these command in a `sh`-like shell.

For more examples, compile and check the `./demo.bash` examples.

At the time of writing these lines, Github doesn't support coloring.

You will need to either 
* checkout this repository, compile and run the [demo.sh](./demo.sh) script
* check out the Asciinema showcase, but they also have issues with the brighter colors, some styles, ...
* get a better Markdown reader

Text examples are available in the [Examples.md](./Examples.md) file.

# Specification

`cecho` takes at least 1 argument: a format and as many arguments as necessary.

It works in the style of `printf`.

## Format

The format is a string of characters made of regular strings and placeholders.

Example: `Some text followed by a specifier {}`

## Specifiers

Specified in `{}`, rust/python style.

A specifier may contain whitespaces (` `, `\t`, ...) for an easier read.

A specifier's text and color parts may be in any order.

The specifier may contain the following information.

### A color

The color is indicated with `#`.

The color may be regular or bright.

The color is specified with different formats: code (number), single letter or word.

The color short names are based on the
RGB: `r`ed, `g`reen, `b`lue,
and CMYKW: `c`yan, `m`agenta, `y`ellow, blac`k` + `w`hite conventions.

Lower case is the normal variant, upper case is the bright variant.

#### Named colors reference table

| Name    | code | short |  long   | code bright | short bright | long bright |
|---------|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Black   |  0   |   b   |  black  |      8      |      B       |    BLACK    |
| Red     |  1   |   r   |   red   |      9      |      R       |     RED     |
| Green   |  2   |   g   |  green  |     10      |      G       |    GREEN    |
| Yellow  |  3   |   y   | yellow  |     11      |      Y       |   YELLOW    |
| Blue    |  4   |   b   |  blue   |     12      |      B       |    BLUE     |
| Magenta |  5   |   m   | magenta |     13      |      M       |   MAGENTA   |
| Cyan    |  6   |   c   |  cyan   |     14      |      C       |    CYAN     |
| White   |  7   |   w   |  white  |     15      |      W       |    WHITE    |

You can also use any hexadecimal color like brown: `#54370f`.

The usual notation applies: `#RRGGBB` in hexadecimal format.

#### Foreground/background

The color may be applied to either the foreground, the background or both.

Split with slash foreground over background.

`#foreground/background`

Either side is optional.

`#red` is a red font, regular background.
`#/green` is a regular font, green background.
`#red/green` is a red font, green background.
`#/` is no color, same as not specifying a color.

### A reference

Unlike `printf` where the order of arguments is forced,
`cecho` may use arguments in any order with `%x` 
where `x` is an integer referring to the arguments passed to `cecho`.

To use it like `printf` do

```bash
cecho '{} {} {}' a b c
``` 

`a b c`

To use it like a python format do

```bash
cecho '{%3} {%2} {%1}' a b c
``` 

`c b a`

### A style

Supports all the styles that the ANSI escape codes allows.

A style can be specified with the long option or the short option 
`{style=bold}` or `{!bold}`.

Some styles have several names.

#### Bold

`{style=bold}`

#### Dim

`{style=dim}`
`{style=faint}`

#### Italic

`{style=italic}`

#### Underline

`{style=underline}`

#### Blink

`{style=blink}`
`{style=blinking}`

#### Inverted

`{style=invert}`

`{style=inverted}`

`{style=inverse}`

`{style=reverse}`

`{style=reversed}`

#### Hidden

`{style=hidden}`

`{style=invisible}`

#### Strike through

`{style=strikethrough}`

`{style=strike}`

## Speed

```bash
hyperfine --shell=none 'target/release/cecho "foo {!bold color=rgb(1,2,3)} bar {style=blink index=2 #k/R} baz" "Wagamama" "Sakura"'
```

```
Benchmark 1: target/release/cecho "foo {!bold color=rgb(1,2,3)} bar {style=blink index=2 #k/R} baz" "Wagamama" "Sakura"
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):       1.7 ms Â±   0.2 ms    [User: 1.1 ms, System: 0.5 ms]
  Range (min â€¦ max):     1.1 ms â€¦   3.3 ms    1155 runs
```

Is it fast? Is it slow? Surely fast enough to satisfy your eyes' bandwidth :)

## Size

A bit chubby.

```
ll target/release/cecho
-rwxrwxr-x 2 uuh uuh 2,1M Okt 11 19:46 target/release/cecho
```

## Goals

No `-` `--` `-n` `-e` etc. ambiguity as in `echo`

No `%x` and other random characters like in `printf`

No looking up for color code indexes nor figuring out which option is correct like in tput.

Useful english nouns but allow existing styles for easy migration form those tools.

Support color.

Fast! Native binary.

Format support Ã  la printf but with modern format specifiers:

* selectors
    * positional `{}`
    * indexed `{%1}`
* styles
    * simple colors `{#red}`
    * reset to default after printing? `{#red!preserve}` or auto reset? ðŸ¤”
    * any color `{#A03472}`
    * background colors `{#white/red}`
* Styles: bold, italic, blink, reset, ... `{!bold}`
* Position on screen `{@5,10}`

## Motivation

Must be simple to start with and not trap people by default!

Must be powerfull enough to not require extra tooling if it's easier, be it

* bash's number formatting trick `$(([##7]v))` for format the variable v in base 7 for instance
* printf's decimal formatting
* escape sequences or tput coloring

I'm tired of looking up color codes and have unreadable color escape sequences.

I don't want to play with `tput setaf 3` and have an unreadable echo statement.

I'm tired of looking up printf's formats, I didn't touch C for years. I use modern languages with friendlier formatting
options.

I don't want to build another layer of bash workarounds. It still contains all of echo's flaws regarding `-` `-n` `-e`
and escape sequences.

I don't want to start a real scripting language, or even worse: the JVM, to highlight a few lines of output in a bash
script.

It may as well be comprehensive so there's 1 tool that gives access to all of the shell's printing capabilities if the
format string remains terse.
I'm likely engaging on a slippery slope but we'll see if it's possible.

I don't want to import and redeclare the colors each time I use them. This should be done once and for all.

### Limitation in current tools

Mix of bash's base formatting, sprintf's decimal formatting, echo workarounds, escape sequences or tput, alternative
tool that auto-color based on various criteria

### Alternatives?

TODO: is there anything that comes close to this?

If yes list here.

#### DIY

### Shell / Scripts

Fish has an easy way to set a color

## Format specifiers brainstorming

All the format given below are assumed ot be enclosed in `{}`

It must be possible to easily combine the format speficifiers.

Format types:

* Name 1st position
* Number format `%`
* Color `#`
* Position `@`
* Style `!`
* Option `?`

```bash
cecho '{?named}{foo@2,3#r%1.2!bold}' --foo=3.1415
```

Shows the content of foo, at the cursor row 2 column 3, in red, with 2 decimals, in bold.

<pre>
<b style="color:red;">3.14</b>
</pre>

### Name

Must be first to avoid ambiguities

### Number format

printf style?

In that case why not delegate the formatting to `printf`?

### Position

`@row,column`

Support relative movement?

### Styles

`!style`

TODO: continuous style (from the marker until cancelled)

### Options

Similar to regex options `(?=...)`

`?option`

## TODOs

Use `{*}` to mean "and here goes all the rest of the args if there are any left"

Index is 0-based or 1-based?

Error message improvements: position hint

### Decimal formatting

TODO: is there another readily available program that could do the number formatting 
and let me not re-implement the wheel?

Leave this to `printf` ?

```bash
cecho '{02.02}' '9.8'
```

`09.80`

TODO: extends the spec to support generalized number formats

https://alvinalexander.com/programming/printf-format-cheat-sheet/

### In-place formatting

```bash
cecho '{"this is blue#blue}'
```

<span style="color:blue;"> `this is blue` </span>

```bash
cecho "{'this is not\\#blue}"
```

`this is not#blue`

### Extra opt-in features

These will break the features above and must be selected explicitly

#### Named arguments

```bash
cecho '{?named}{foo} and {bar}' --foo=A --bar=B
```

`A and B`

Regular behaviour:

```bash
cecho '{foo} and {bar}' --foo=A --bar=B
```

`--foo=A and --bar=B`

#### Recursion

This one may become unmanageable but let's see if it's possible anyway.

It recursively evaluates the arguments 1 by 1, modifying the format at each evaluation.

```bash
cecho '{?recurse}' '{?named}{foo}' --foo='{03.5@blue}' '3.14159265359'
```

Step by step this is equivalent to

```bash
cecho '{!recurse}{?named}{foo}' --foo='{03.5@blue}' '3.14159265359'
```

```bash
cecho '{!recurse}{?named}{03.5@blue}' '3.14159265359'
```

```bash
cecho '{!recurse}{?named}3.14159'
```

TODO: distinguish indexed argument from number formatting.

<span style="color:blue;"> `003.14159` </span>

TODO: what if the terminal only supports 8 colors? Find the closest color that matches?
